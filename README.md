# Food App Review Embeddings, Visualizations, and Clustering
## Overview

This repository contains code and resources related to generating embeddings for a food app review dataset using the Sentence Transformer model (specifically, the all_MiniLm_L6_v2 variant). The embeddings are visualized in 2D and 3D vector spaces using UMAP and Plotly, and k-means clustering is applied to the embeddings.
# Dependencies
